//! A collection of utilities used by our other libraries in this workspace.
//!
//! - Pedersen commitment
//! - Elgamal encryption, including Hashed Elgamal
//! - finite field utilities like inner product, weighted inner product, hadamard product, etc.
//! - multiscalar multiplication (MSM) like Fixed Base MSM
//! - polynomial utilities like multiplying polynomials, creating polynomial from roots, etc.
//! - An efficient way to check several equality relations involving pairings by combining the relations in a random linear combination and doing a multi-pairing check. Relies on Schwartz–Zippel lemma.
//! - An efficient way to check several equality relations involving scalar multiplications by combining the relations in a random linear combination and doing a single multi-scalar multiplication check. Relies on Schwartz–Zippel lemma.
//! - hashing utilities like hashing arbitrary bytes to field element or group element.
//! - solving discrete log using Baby Step Giant Step algorithm
